### [Comics Book](https://github.com/Askat08/e-store) e-store

This is small nice user-friendly application will help you find your favorite [marvel](https://www.marvel.com/) superhero comic book.

### I built this project to showcase my Frontend skills abilities.

From what I know, I think I violated the DRY principle in App.js component, sorry -\_-, I'm working hard on it.

in the beginning I thought to build a simple e-commerce store then I wanted to get higher result within the other applicants. I hope I did good enough.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
