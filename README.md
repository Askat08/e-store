### [Comics Book](https://github.com/Askat08/e-store) e-store

This is small nice user-friendly application will help you find your favorite [marvel](https://www.marvel.com/) superhero book.

### I built this project to showcase my Frontend skills abilities.

From what I know, I violated the DRY principle App.js component, sorry -\_-, working hard on it.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
